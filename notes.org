* Boardgame
  I want to play with the idea of a board game and writing several engines to
  play the game.
  This is going to be very open-ended, the main goal is to explore different
  ways of implementing a player AI.
  But I will also need an actual game to play. I want something less rigid
  than chess, less complicated than, say, Battletech, I want to allow for an
  arbitrary number of players.
  I also anticipate experimenting with different programming languages. I
  think I am going to create some sort of network protocol for engines to play
  so that I can pit different engines against each other that are written in
  different languages.

** Rules
   I could use a grid as in chess, go, reversi, etc., or I could use a
   "continuous" board as in Warhammer 40k. I kind of like the latter, so I
   think I am going to with that.
   But it will make the board more difficult if I want to have any sort of
   terrain instead of an empty, featureless plane as in chess.
   I want to have different pieces as in chess. The pieces shall have the
   following characteristics:
   - Range
   - Damage
   - Hit points
   - Speed
*** Board
    Okay, after thinking about a little, I am going to go with a rectangular
    board and a grid. Each field can have an elevation, so features of the
    terrain can be used for cover. Fields should have further qualities, if
    they have negative elevation, I want fields that are more difficult to
    cross (i.e. a lake or river) and fields that are impossible to cross. 
    I want to be able to edit and display/render boards easily.

    I've gone down quite the rabbit hole, and it has given me a case of
    mind-paralysis. It's like there's so many possibilities, I cannot choose
    just one. This isn't good.
    I think I should start by devising a *simple* board game, and then I can
    grow it from there.
    How about a single player game, you have a terrain and need to reach a
    certain field with the least possible number of moves?
    Yes, sounds good.

    After being very enthusiastic when I first thought of this project, I have
    been kind stuck for the past days. But I did have a few thoughts pop into
    my mind this weekend.
    The main idea for a player / "AI" is cost and goals.
    The player has to reach some goal, e.g. reach a certain field on the
    board, and doing things, such as moving, has a cost in action points.
    To reach the goal costs a certain amount, and the idea I just had was to
    evaluate each possible move by how much it lowers that cost for subsequent
    moves.
